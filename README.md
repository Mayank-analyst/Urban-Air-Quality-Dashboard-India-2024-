# 🌫️ Urban Air Quality Dashboard – India (2024)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **urban air quality across major Indian cities in 2024** using AQI and pollutant data.  
The dataset was **cleaned and preprocessed in Excel**, analytical insights were generated using **SQL queries**, and the final results were visualized using an **interactive Power BI dashboard**.

The goal of this project is to identify **pollution patterns, high-risk periods, major pollutant contributors, and city-wise AQI trends**.

## 🔄 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning (Excel)
- Removed duplicate records
- Handled missing and inconsistent values
- Standardized city names and date formats
- Created derived columns (Month, Day Type – Weekday/Weekend)
- Prepared a clean dataset ready for SQL analysis

### 2️⃣ Data Analysis (SQL)
- Calculated average and maximum AQI values
- Identified high-risk AQI days
- Analyzed pollutant-wise contribution to AQI
- Performed city-wise AQI aggregation
- Compared weekday vs weekend air quality

### 3️⃣ Data Visualization (Power BI)
- Built KPI cards for key metrics
- Created interactive charts and slicers
- Designed a clean, insight-driven dashboard layout
- Added AQI insights and trend analysis

## 🧠 Key Insights
- **PM2.5 is the dominant contributor** to poor air quality across most cities
- Air quality is **slightly worse on weekends**, possibly due to increased travel and leisure activities
- Seasonal AQI spikes are observed in specific months
- Metro cities consistently record **higher average AQI levels**
